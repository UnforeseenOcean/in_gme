Changes
========================

Version 0.5 beta 3:
* Added configuration dialog
(options will use a INI, not the Registry)
* Added custom title formatting
* Adjusted decoding thread priority
* Rewrote several internal portions of code for clarity
* Rewrote how title formatting operates

Version 0.5 beta 2a:
* Removed custom silence detection, now uses gme_track_ended() all around.

Version 0.5 beta 2:
* Fixed string formatting for files without tags. Files without tags will only show the filename without extension.
* Files without time settings will loop indefinately. Seeking will work for up to 3 minutes regardless of filetype.
* Fixed time reading for files that don't fill out info.length. Song length is then derived from info.intro_length + info.loop_length. This is needed for files from Project2612.org.
* Automatic subsong track end detection of silence in subsong based formats. The player will then move to the next subsong if silence occurs for around 2 seconds.
* Singular track songs now will move to the next song, like other formats in Winamp, on track end.
* Added NSIS installer. It will detect for Winamp plugin directory.

Version 0.5 beta 1:
* Added seeking
* Added subsong support to all formats that support it

Version 0.3:
* Added song info dialog
* Fixed all compiler warnings in main plugin code
* Fixed sample buffer size to be of a smaller size
* Added time detection
* Plugin no longer needs MSVC2008 runtimes
* Switched to using TDW's builds of mingw (bleeding edge GCC ports) and Code::Blocks.
* Optimized file size 

Version 0.1:
* Initial release
